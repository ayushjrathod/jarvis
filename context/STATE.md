# STATE — read me first each session

_Last updated: 2026-07-06 (session 2, end)_

## Current phase

**ALL FIVE PHASES BUILT AND VERIFIED.** v1 is feature-complete per the spec.
The system is live under systemd user services right now. Awaiting the user's
end-to-end hardware test (their stated plan) and reboot test.

## What runs where (verified live)

- `mission-dispatcher.service` — enabled + running; dashboard at
  http://127.0.0.1:8765/; crash auto-restart verified (kill -9 → new PID).
- Timers enabled: mission-daily-brief 07:30, mission-weekly-review Sun 18:00,
  mission-backup 03:30 (first backup already in data/backups/).
- `mission-jarvis.service` — installed, **deliberately not enabled** (user
  must be in `input` group + audio ready): `systemctl --user enable --now
  mission-jarvis`. Manual run still works (`python -m jarvis.main`).
- 31 unit tests green; smoke_phase_a.sh + smoke_phase_b.py both pass.

## What the user still needs to do

1. `sudo usermod -aG input $USER` + re-login → then enable mission-jarvis.
2. Reboot test (Phase E acceptance): after reboot,
   `journalctl --user -u mission-* -b` should show clean startups. Consider
   `loginctl enable-linger ayra` for boot-without-login.
3. Optional: Gmail MCP (`claude-per mcp add gmail …`) → email section appears
   in daily briefs automatically.
4. Optional: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` → quick path switches to low-latency
   Messages API (set it in mission-dispatcher.service env or shell).

## Known caveats (details in CLAUDE.md + session logs)

- Barge-in needs headphones or PipeWire echo-cancel.
- `Write(path)` allowedTools rules silently ignored — use `Edit(path/**)`.
- Area triggers match as in-order word subsequences (dispatcher/areas.py).
- Timers no-op (journal an error) if the dispatcher is down.

## Deferred (per spec, do not build unprompted)

Other life areas, cloud Routines, multi-agent fan-out, media area (mpv/yt-dlp),
Kokoro TTS swap.
